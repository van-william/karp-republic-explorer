## Rough Chapter Summaries:

- Part 1: Software Century
The current generation of software engineers has become unmoored from any core purpose or grander meaning in their work. Even more so, many are hesitant to even think about defense applications. The internet was founded out of a defense program (DARPA); nowadays, that would be unthinkable.
    - Lost Valley — Silicon Valley has strayed significantly from its tradition of collaboration with the US Government; focusing primarily on the consumer market and avoiding defense altogether
    - Sparks of Intelligence — LLMs are on the verge of true AGI (Artificial General Intelligence); combined with advanced robotics, a new age is dawning.
    - Winner’s Fallacy — the issue with winning WW2 and the Cold War is that American military supremacy and shared purpose has grown lax. (William Buckley — “I would rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the phone book than by Harvard University Faculty”)
    - End of the Atomic Age — the supremacy of American military power in some ways created a time of peace (Pax Americana?). However, the commitment to the maintenance of this has been lost. e.g., Europe has not shared in the costs of this maintenance (e..g, NATO investment from European countries). Battlefield innovation is lagging. the The F-35 program is planned out until 2088 with a program cost of $2 Trillion… “Will we really have manned fighters in 2088???”
- Part 2: Hollowing out of the American Mind
There has been a fundamental dismantling of the American / Western identity. People are against supporting Defense / Government projects, but are slow to say what they actually stand for.
    - Abandonment of Belief — People are clearly against certain things but it’s more and more unclear what people are actually “for”. In addition, protected anonymity and social media may be robbing this generation of an opportunity to develop an instict for real ownership over an idea… of the rewards of victory in the public square as well as the costs of defeat.
    - Technological Agnostics — people began to build because they enjoyed building. they were detached from purpose, outcomes, etc. case in point: the acceleration of “Farmville” esque enterprises
    - A Balloon Cut Loose — the abandonment of Western Civilization led to a loose anchoring of American purpose and destination
    - Flawed Systems: The focus and obsession on the individual was potentially long-term detrimental to US growth (e.g., how many delivery apps and photo sharing apps do we really need?)
    - Lost in Toyland: the flaws of eToys: startup built by Toby Lenk. It was a $10B toy e-commerce store at its height. The issue was the shallowness of vision. The entrepreneurial vision was so focused towards lifestyle improvement: Making middle Americans feel wealthier because of better entertainment. Silicon Valley abandoned higher ambitions of industrial revolution, transportation, safety, etc. in lieu of social media.
- Part 3: Engineering Mindset
Palantir and other tech startups have fundamentally rejected the traditional corporate structure. Applying the engineering mindset to corporate structure has yielded a lot of fruit. Creative friction and rejecting intellectual fragility are vital to growth.Skepticism of ideology in favor of pursuit of results (Pragmatism) are VITAL
    - The Eck Swarm
    - The Improvisational Startup
    - The Disapproval of the Crowd
    - Building a Better Rifle — When marines asked for a better rifle, the army built it; now, the army needs better intelligence tools and faster procurement processes; majority of US congress has not served in the military (drastic contrast to 80 years ago)
    - A Cloud or a Clock — foxes vs. hedgehogs.
- Part 4: Rebuilding the Technological Republic
Silicon Valley remains reticent to enter public domains (Medicine, education, law, defense, etc.). Rebuilding a technological republic will also require a reassertion of national culture and values. It will require a clearer identity and purpose.

    - Piety and its Price
    - Next Thousand Years
    - An Aesthetic Point of View
