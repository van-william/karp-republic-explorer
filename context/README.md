## How to Add Context

1. Create `.md` files in this directory with your notes
2. The AI will automatically search and include relevant context based on user questions
3. Use descriptive filenames that reflect the content (e.g., `soft-belief.md`, `technological-power.md`)

## File Structure Examples
