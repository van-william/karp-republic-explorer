## Rough Notes

- Silicon Valley has gone from a vanguard of defense innovation to shying away from any collaboration with DoD / military / primes / etc.
- We (US) seem to think it’s low brow to work on defense projects in tech but let other countries do it
- We (US) are essentially funding NATO’s security through our defense budget
- We (US) won World War 2 through supreme manufacturing capacity
- China is our biggest political adversary right now
- Top image recognition / facial recognition companies are mostly based outside the US
- <0.2% of the DoD budget is targeting Artificial Intelligence; this is a concern of priorities
- Hypothesis: The cost-plus contracts were necessary to galvanize US’s industrial base to enable military capacity; however, this also was later unchecked and grew into an unhealthy military industrial complex.
- Similar to Zero to One by Peter Thiel, Karp talks a lot about America’s view of indefinite Optimism. Contrasted to Europe’s definite pessimism, there’s this indefinite optimism in the US that the US will cotninue to be a leader / great country. This does not come passively.
- US curriculum also stopped teaching Western Civilization
    - This seemed like a minro chnage but overall, it was difficult to ascribe clear meaning or purpose of the US. US history was no longer anchored by Europe history.
    - This “deconstruction” of a coherent western civilization led to later ambiguity in purpose
- THe idea of technological agnostics
    - Technological Agnostics: people building stuff because it’s interesting; divorced from any broader or greater purpose
    - Karp quotes the rising employment of finance and management consulting careers
    - Mixing technological agnosticism with a concentrated supply base — how will these concentrated companies remain accountable to the american public?
- The technological agnostic idea is also related to overall misdirection of tech in silicon valley
    - Peter Thiel said we wanted flying cars and space travel but instead we got 140 characters (twitter)
    - With the removal of western civilization, there’s a lack of grounding in terms of American history; why did we get here? where did we come from?
- Consolidation of power is also a concern with this level of ambiguity and ambivalence towards applications of tech
- Hard power vs. soft power
    - Hard power is coercive
    - Soft power is influential
    - Hard Power examples:
        - Military strength
        - Sanctions
        - Compelling force
        - Immediate
    - Soft power
        - persuasion
        - public diplomacy
        - Foreign policy
    - Karp views that the US is neglecting hard power. Military spending and investment has been misguided
    - Silicon Valley has engaged with trivial pursuits
    - The decline in teaching western civilization teaching has created this; there’s a lack of grounding in terms of the American purpose and focus; there’s a sense of aimlessness and drifting with a lack of western civ.
